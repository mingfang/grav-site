# Accounting Blockchain Coalition
The Accounting Blockchain Coalition is an initiative started by ConsenSysâ€™ Balanc3 team which empowers its members to gauge the impacts that blockchain technology brings to the accounting industry and drive innovation. Coalition members include accounting firms, accounting associations, standards setting bodies, regulators, law firms, investors, and blockchain innovators. The members partake in monthly calls to educate each other on best practices around blockchain for the accounting industry, focusing on topics like valuation, financial statement presentation, and legacy systems upgrades. Five ABC working groups were announced at the ABC Conference in June, which was attended by over 400 accounting and blockchain professionals at Microsoft Technology Center.

Assurance of Blockchain Companies

Taxation of Digital Assets

Digital Asset Management

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems

These working groups and the professionals involved will be setting the accounting guidance and standards around the accelerating blockchain industry.
